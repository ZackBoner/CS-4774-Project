# CS-4774-Project

This project seeks to expose environmental inequalities in the state of Virginia, and develop indexes to better understand how different socioeconomic groups are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. We cluster data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) to pinpoint problematic zones in the state, and overlay census data to find correlations between class, race, and income with environmental health and quality. We will leverage our results to demand Environmental Equity, where no one group is disadvantaged by their natural environment because of their socioeconomic background. The implications of clustering census and environmental data could influence state legislation to preserve a healthier environment and more just living conditions for Virginia's residents.
